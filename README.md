### Project Descripttion

> **Verifying a candidate's credentials and expertise prior to hiring is one of the most elementary yet crucial responsibilities for every company. Verifying applicant credentials and expertise is becoming increasingly time-consuming due to the rising number of applicants, particularly in larger organisations. 
> As a result, it is frequently skipped. The HR department is increasingly concerned about the issue of candidates providing false information, and while traditional talent verification tools are helpful, they are still far from ideal for handling it.
> The best solution to this issue will be blockchain-based talent verification because it offers a transparent, reliable, and independent platform and speeds up the process of completing competency tests. With blockchain, any user can enter their credentials, credentials, and work history, and have those credentials transparently confirmed by their coworkers, supervisors, and team leaders at their individual companies.
> With our approach, each user receives a special ID. Any candidate's credentials may be easily verified because each of their talents will have a list of related certifications and endorsements. After being approved by the managers or employers of their current firm, skills will also receive a verified badge. 
> Platforms like LinkedIn will cross-verify new users and businesses via OAuth to add another degree of verification. Along with the usual information, organisations must also have at least two verified manager-level personnel. Users can only add a company to their job history when the company has authorised their joining request.
